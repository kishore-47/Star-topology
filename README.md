⭐ Star Topology – Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation
A simple and reliable network design using Star Topology, created in Cisco Packet Tracer for learning basic LAN setup and connectivity.

📘 Project Overview
In Star Topology, all devices connect to a central switch, ensuring efficient communication and easy troubleshooting.
This setup is widely used in LAN environments due to its scalability and reliability.

🖥️ Network Design
Topology Structure:

Central Device: 1 Switch (Cisco 2960-24TT)

End Devices: 5–6 PCs connected to the switch

Connectivity: Each PC has a dedicated cable to the switch

⚙️ Components Used
Device Type	Quantity	Purpose
Switch (2960-24TT)	1	Central connection point
PC-PT	5–6	End-user devices
Copper Straight-Through	N	Connect PCs to the switch

🔧 Steps to Configure
Connect Devices: Use Copper Straight-Through cables from each PC to the Switch.

Assign IPs:
Example:

PC1 → 192.168.1.1/24

PC2 → 192.168.1.2/24

PC3 → 192.168.1.3/24

Test Connectivity:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping <other_pc_ip>
All PCs should communicate successfully through the switch.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Learn switch-based connectivity

Practice IP addressing and ping testing

Explore Packet Tracer simulations

🧠 Advantages of Star Topology
✅ Easy installation & management
✅ Centralized control via the switch
✅ Fault isolation (a failed device/cable won’t break the whole network)
